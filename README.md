# SMO

## Introduction 

Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) is an algorithm used for training Support Vector Machines (SVMs). It is used to solve the quadratic programming (QP) problem by breaking it into a series of smaller, more manageable sub-problems, each of which can be solved analytically.

I am undertaking this project as part of an internship at the Okayama University Laboratory, supervised by Dr. Takahashi Norikazu.

# Dataset

I am using the Iris Dataset from scikit-learn.
